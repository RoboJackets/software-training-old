* What are we doing today?
- Data Structures
  - Different types
  - Uses
  - Advantages and Disadvantages
- Templates

* Data Structures
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Make sure it's clear that each data structure has a niche it can fill. Thinking with data structures is a matter of picking the right tool for the job.
#+END_NOTES
- Data structures (or containers, collections) are objects that group together elements of data
- Different data structures offer different advantages and disadvantages in terms of how data is related or how efficient it is to interact with the data

* Lists
#+BEGIN_NOTES
The list class in the STL is specifically a doubly-linked list, but we're talking about the abstract data type here. Make sure they don't confuse the two.
#+END_NOTES
- A list is any data structure that is ordered
- Useful when relative ordering between elements is important
- There are various different implementations of lists in the C++ standard library

* Arrays and Vectors
- You already have worked with arrays, which are built into the syntax of C++
- Vectors are more formal arrays that handle resizing for you and have a number of helpful built-in methods
- Advantages: elements are ordered and easily retrievable
- Disadvantages: capacity is fixed; sometimes needs to shift all elements (costly) to preserve order after adding/removing

* Linked Lists (forward_list, list)
#+BEGIN_NOTES
forward_list and list are the STL implementations of singly-linked and doubly-linked lists, respectively. You'll want to illustrate how the nodes work in some way. If there's no white board available, maybe type up a node class really quickly to show how next pointers work.
#+END_NOTES
- Lists in which each element "points" to the next element in the list
- The programmer has access to the list's "head" (the first element) and sometimes the "tail" (the last element)
- Advantages: flexible capacity, easy to add and remove data from the front and back
- Disadvantages: retrieving elements in the middle of the list requires starting at the head and then traversing the list until the desired element is found

* Stacks
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Some useful CSy examples: back/forward buttons, undo/redo, function activation.

You can actually specify which container you want to back the STL stack/queue. By default it's backed by a deque, but you can choose a vector or a list instead.
#+END_NOTES
- LIFO (last-in first-out) list with two key functions:
  - Push: Places an element on the stack
  - Pop: Removes the element most recently added to the stack
- Implemented using another list (Vector, Linked List); inherits its properties

* Queues
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Some obvious useful examples: literally anything that ends in "queue" (printer queue, process queue, people queue).
#+END_NOTES
- FIFO (first-in first-out) list with two key functions:
  - Push: Adds an element to the end of the queue
  - Pop: Removes the element at the front of the queue
- Also backed by another list

* Sets and Maps
#+BEGIN_NOTES
The highlight here is access time. Good for keeping records of data to be accessed later. Phonebook/dictionary analogies work well.
#+END_NOTES
- A set is any data structure without duplicate elements
  - Unlike lists, sets do not necessarily have order
- A map is a set of keys that each point to a corresponding value
  - A key and value are together called a pair or key-value pair
- You can add new pairs to a map, as well as remove or modify existing pairs
- If you provide a map with a key, the map will return its value

* Trees
- A tree is like a linked list, except each element can point to more than one element
- The top node in the tree is called the root
- A node that points to other nodes is a parent node
- A node that's pointed to is called a child node
- Nodes without children are called the leaves of the tree

* Graphs
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Algorithms to discuss: DFS/BFS, Dijkstra's, A*, Minimum Spanning Trees.
#+END_NOTES
- A collection of nodes with edges connecting them
- A more general form of trees
  - More accurately, trees are a specific form of graphs
- Very few constraints; there can be any number of nodes with any number of edges connecting any of them
- Good for modeling maps and networks, which is useful for robotics
- A number of well-known algorithms for processing graphs, also useful for robotics

* Templates
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Good idea to plug the sample code here, as it's easier to explain with examples. There is a simple example on the next slide.
#+END_NOTES
- Templates are a mechanism to make your code generic
- Instead of writing code for a specific data type, you can have a placeholder "generic" type
- The compiler will figure out which type(s) you're actually using and replace the generic type
- All data structures use these to make them compatible with any data

* Templates Example
- Let's say you have the following function that adds two numbers together:
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
#+END_SRC
- Now let's say you want to have the same function for doubles
- You may be tempted to make a second function with the types changed, but you can also do this:
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
    template<class T>
    T add(T a, T b) {
        return a + b;
    }
#+END_SRC
- This not only supports both ints and doubles, but any type that uses the + operator
